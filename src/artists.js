		bio: `Errorr, is a band led by Swedish multi-instrumentalist, musician, and producer Leonard Kaage.  The band stylistically combines a wide range of rock-genres in their music but plays first and foremost both noise and punk rock.  Together, this three-piece creates a wall of sound with vigorous drumming, fuzz-drenched bass, and massive sounding guitars.  The songs are straightforward and direct but never seem to be predictable.`,

		bio: "It’s been an interesting few months for Eddie Argos, illustrious front man of sardonic indie art pioneers Art Brut. In echoes of that seminal hit, he’s only gone and ‘Formed A Band’ look at him, he’s formed a band!…a Bob Dylan covers band at that – with fellow Berlin artist’s Olga Karatzioti-B. and Leonard Kaage of Errorr and The Underground Youth fame. “I’ve always wanted to make a Dylan covers album,” says an enthusiastic Argos, “but the opportunity really came up when, during Lockdown, I heard my neighbours practicing their songs through the floor, and thought to myself ‘they sound like they need a singing partner‘. I’d heard them practicing Pixies the week before so I knew they were awesome dudes. We’d also been looking after each other‘s cats.”",
