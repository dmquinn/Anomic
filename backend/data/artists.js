    name: "Nico Novak",
    description:
      "Niko Novak is known to many as the singer of the punk rock band Dicky B. Hardy back in his hometown Ljubljana, Slovenia. The band released 3 albums and toured all over Europe and in the United States twice.\n But this was back in 1994 until 2001. Now he lives in Berlin and has been releasing 4 full-length albums with the spaced-out blues duo Incurabili and another four under his own name.\nTogether with the albums from his solo career comes a book with all the lyrics from the albums. This is not surprising as the lyrical content is a very important part of his music.\nHis dark and haunting voice tells reflections and stories that are sung over the minimalistic strumming on his electric bass guitar.\nThe music could have been taken directly from a 1960’s black and white avant-garde movie and makes the listener stop whatever they are doing and pay attention.\nHis songs might not be the best choice for a Saturday night in a packed bar but as said in his own words: The songs are mostly about sitting in bars, drinking beer.",

    name: "Kick",
    description:
      "KICK are Chiara Amalia Bernardini (vocals, bass) and Nicola Mora (guitars, electric piano, synths, samplers), from Brescia. Their sound combines rough elements and others more dreamy in a sound that could ideally be defined as “sweet noise”, a style on their own melting the noise with the softness of the atmosphere, without any limits of genre.\n The first single Setting Tina, out on July 5th, 2021, sees as a guest on bass Scott Reeder, long-time member of Kyuss and currently of Fireball Ministry.\n Bernardini’s lyrics, for the first time not only in English but in some tracks also in Italian, focus both on the recurring theme of love and on social issues. Very active also live, both in Italy and abroad",

    description:
      "Errorr was started in 2020 by Swedish Leonard Kaage, mostly known as the guitar player of The Underground youth and for his work with bands like The Blue Angel Lounge, Anton Newcombe and Tess Parks and many more. In 2021 Nick Mangione (Perilymph) and André Leo (Medecin Boy) joined the band. The four-piece blends big choruses with fuzz-drenched guitar feedback. The band has quickly become a name in the underground rock scene in their hometown Berlin as well as around Europe, UK, and the US. The debut EP was released in 2021 and a full-length album followed by a list of concert dates is to be expected in 2022..",

      "Post-punk band Dada Jung Riley attributes more sense to the nonsense and sources its inspiration through the chaotic yet systemic nature of the mind\nRichard Mutt, singer and guitarist, and Ellis Haller on the drums, come together as a two-piece band to perform noise and garage rock. Ritualistic riffs and droning beats dance together in destructive jams, building bridges from human civilized states to hidden darker realms, before setting it all on fire and spitting rage into the face of a dying world.",

      "Wombed is an experimental music project led by Berlin-based, Cape Town-born musician, André Leo.\nBirthed in the murky waters of 2020, the debut EP Still Nothing is described by Leo as ‘cough syrup blues’ and is a merger of his love for acoustic roots music and washed-out, unsettling ambiance.\n2021’s Skinning Music EP trades in the acoustic guitar for dictaphones, Mellotron, tube amps, and a Tascam 4 Track.\nThese two self-produced EP’s mark the closing of the first cycle of Wombed and a full-length album is currently being recorded, pulling on different influences and spilling noisier, discordant colors over the musical canvas.",

The debut album was released on Berlins 8mm Musik and Anton Newcombe’s record label A Recordings.\nIt is now being re-released on Anomic Records.",

      "The pandemic had hit Berlin hard and the three neighbors were unable to continue their everyday lives as normal. When the rules allowed it, Eddi Argos, known from Art Brut, Olga Karatzioti-B. from Anomic Records, and Leonard Kaage from Errorr, could meet up for drinks in the bar right under them. Every time this happened they started to talk about the idea of playing music together. Somehow Bob Dylan often came up as a topic, whether it was a love for his music or a dislike didn’t matter. Soon they went from jamming on Dylan songs in the living room of one of their flats to recording a full-length album of Bob Dylan covers in Kaage’s studio.",
